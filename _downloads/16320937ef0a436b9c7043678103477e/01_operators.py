MATH OPERATORS - used to perform basic operations
    - Addition (+)          # Used to add two numbers
    - Subtraction (-)       # Used to subtract two numbers
    - Multiplication (*)    # Used to multiply two numbers
    - Division (/)          # Used to divide two numbers
    - Modulus (%)           # Returns the remainder of the division
    - Exponentiation (**)   # Raises the first number to the power of the second number
    - Floor division (//)   # Returns the integer part of the division result

    OPERANDS - Operands are the values that the operator acts on.

Order of operations is determined by precedence:
    - Parentheses ()
    - Exponents (**)
    - Multiplication and Division (*, /, %, //)
    - Addition and Subtraction (+, -)
    if two operators have the same precedence, they are applied from left to right

BOOLEAN OPERATORS - used to combine conditional statements
    - not  # Returns True if the statement is false and vice versa
    - and  # Returns True if both statements are true
    - or   # Returns True if one of the statements is true

COMPARISON OPERATORS - used to compare two values, returns a boolean value.
    - greater than (>)      # Returns True if the left operand is greater than the right operand
    - less than (<)         # Returns True if the left operand is less than the right operand
    - greater than or equal to (>=)  # Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand
    - less than or equal to (<=)     # Returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand
    - equal to (==)         # Returns True if the operands are equal
    - not equal to (!=)     # Returns True if the operands are not equal

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS (=) - used to assign values to variables

BITWISE OPERATORS - used to perform bitwise operations
    - &   # Bitwise AND
    - |   # Bitwise OR
    - ^   # Bitwise XOR
    - ~   # Bitwise NOT
    - <<  # Bitwise left shift
    - >>  # Bitwise right shift

IDENTITY OPERATORS - used to compare the memory location of two objects
    - is      # Returns True if both variables are the same object
    - is not  # Returns True if both variables are not the same object

MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS - used to test if a sequence is present in an object
    - in      # Returns True if a sequence is present in the object
    - not in  # Returns True if a sequence is not present in the object
