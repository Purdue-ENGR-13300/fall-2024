"""
REPETITION STRUCTURES (also known as iteration structures or loops)
keywords : while, for

1. While loop: A while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
    while condition:
        statement(s)

2. For loop: A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence or other iterable objects.
Syntax:
    for element in sequence:
        statement(s)

For vs while loop:
- For loop is used when the number of iterations is known
- While loop is used when the number of iterations is not known
- For loop is more concise and readable
- While loop is more flexible and powerful

3. Nested loop: A loop inside another loop.
Syntax:
    for element in sequence:
        statement(s)
        while condition:
            statement(s)
    statement(s)

4. Loop control statements: These statements change the execution from its normal sequence.
    - break: Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.
    - continue: Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
    - pass: Does nothing.
    - return: Exits the function and returns a value.
