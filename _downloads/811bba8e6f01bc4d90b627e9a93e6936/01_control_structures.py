"""
CONTROL STRUCTURES - determine the flow of execution in a program.

Here are the different types of control structures in Python:

1. Sequential Execution - default mode of execution where statements are executed line by line.

2. Conditional Statements - used to execute a block of code based on a condition.
- if            - executes a block of code if the condition is True
- if-else       - executes a block of code if the condition is True, otherwise executes another block of code
- if-elif-else  - executes a block of code if the condition is True, otherwise checks another condition
- nested if     - if statement inside another if statement

3. Looping Statements - used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
- for   - iterates over a sequence of items
- while - executes a block of code as long as the condition is True

4. Control Statements - used to control the flow of execution in a program.
- break     - exits the loop
- continue  - skips the current iteration
- pass      - does nothing
- return    - exits the function
- assert    - raises an exception if a condition is False
- raise     - raises an exception
