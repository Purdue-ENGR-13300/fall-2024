"""
INPUT FUNCTION - input()
    user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

Note: Python input() function always returns a string

Converting user input
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
    age = int(age)

Nested functions in Python
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    age = float(input("Enter your age: "))

For the purpose of this course, you will not worry about validating and sanitizing user input.
