"""
VARIABLES - A variable is a name that refers to a value. Variables are used to
store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

Assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable
    - The value on the right side of the assignment operator is assigned to the
      variable on the left side.
    - Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    - They must start with a letter or an underscore.
    - Variable names are case-sensitive.
    - Variables can be reassigned to new values at any time.
    - Variables can point to any data type.

    Expressions are anything that can be evaluated to a value.
        For example: 1+2

    Literals are fixed values that are written directly into the code.
        For example: 1 or "Hello World!"

Assignment statements are used to create variables and assign values to them.
    variable = expression or literal
           a = 1+2
           b = "Hello World!"

COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    - a+=3 equates to a = a + 3 (Add and assign)
    - a-=3 equates to a = a - 3 (Subtract and assign)
    - a*=3 equates to a = a * 3 (Multiply and assign)
    - a/=3 equates to a = a / 3 (Divide and assign)
    - a%=3 equates to a = a % 3 (Modulus and assign)
    - a**=3 equates to a = a ** 3 (Exponentiate and assign)
    - a//=3 equates to a = a // 3 (Floor divide and assign)
    Python does not have increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
